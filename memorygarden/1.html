	<h2> 
	Last year today we met at the party at Gideon’s house. 
	Once Steak told everyone about that guy he knew who 
	wanted to be cuckholded, we left and got high on the roof.
	It was such a weird story, and I wanted to hear it, but 
	I only wanted to hang out with you and you knew it. I 
	wouldn’t have remembered it was the day that we met last 
	year, but Facebook reminded me, and then I thought I 
	wanted to unfriend you, because you have a pretty new 
	girl in your profile picture, and you’re both wearing 
	floor length mink coats, and she looks like she is a lot of fun.
