	<h4>It is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise, and because he loves me so.</h4>

     But I tried it last night. It was moonlight. The moon shines 
     in all around just as the sun does. I hate to see it sometimes, 
     it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by one window or another
     . John was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still 
     and watched the moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till I 
     felt creepy. The faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, 
     just as if she wanted to get out. I got up softly and went to feel 
     and see if the paper did move, and when I came back John was awake. 
     &ldquo;What is it, little girl?" he said. "Don't go walking about like 
     that you'll get cold.&rdquo; I thought it was a good time to talk, so I 
     told him that I really was not gaining here, and that I wished he would
     take me away. &ldquo;Why, darling!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;our lease will be up 
     in three weeks, and I can't see how to leave before. The repairs
     are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now. 
     Of course if you were in any danger, I could and would, but you 
     really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor,
     dear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is better, I feel really much easier about you.&rdquo; 
	</div>		
	
	<div class="rightcentered-box">
		&ldquo;I don't weigh a bit more,&rdquo;
     said I, &ldquo;nor as much; and my appetite may be better in the evening
     when you are here, but it is worse in the morning when you are away!&rdquo;  
     &ldquo;Bless her little heart!&rdquo; said he with a big hug, &ldquo;she shall be as sick as 
     she pleases! But now let's improve the shining hours by going to 
     sleep, and talk about it in the morning!&rdquo; &ldquo;And you won't go away?&rdquo;
     I asked gloomily. &ldquo;Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and
     then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting
     the house ready. Really dear you are better! &ldquo;Better in body 
     perhaps&#8212;&rdquo; I began, and stopped short, for he sat up straight
     and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I could not say another 
     word. &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I beg of you, for my sake and for our child's
     sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let 
     that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating,
     to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish fancy. Can you not 
     trust me as a physician when I tell you so?&rdquo;  So of course I said 
     no more on that score, and we went to sleep before long. He thought I was asleep 
     first, but I wasn't, and lay there for hours trying to decide whether 
     that front pattern and the back pattern really did move together or separately.
