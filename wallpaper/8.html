  Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out. 
  The front pattern does move - and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it! Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, 
  and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over. Then in the very  bright spots she keeps
  still, and in the very shady spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard. 
	</div>		
	
	<div class="rightcentered-box">
		And she is all the time trying to climb 
  through. But nobody could climb through that pattern - it strangles so; I think that is why it has so many heads. They get through, 
  and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside down, and makes their eyes white! If those heads were covered or taken off 
  it would not be half so bad.
