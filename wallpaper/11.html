  	Hurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. 
  	John to stay in town over night, and won't be out until this evening. Jennie wanted to sleep with me - 
  	the sly thing! but I told her I should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone. 
  	That was clever, for really I wasn't alone a bit! As soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake 
  	the pattern, I got up and ran to help her. I pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we had. peeled 
  	off yards of that paper. A strip about as high as my head and half around the room. And then when the sun came and that awful 
  	pattern began to laugh at me, I declared I would finish it today ! We go away tomorrow, and they are moving all my furniture 
  	down again to leave things as they were before. Jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I did it 
  	out of pure spite at the vicious thing. She laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself, but I must not get tired. 
  	How she betrayed herself that time! But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me, not alive! She tried to get me out 
  	of the room --it was too patent! But I said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down again and 
  	sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner - I would call when I woke. So now she is gone, and the servants are gone, 
  	and the things are gone, and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the canvas mattress we found on it. 
  	We shall sleep downstairs tonight, and take the boat home tomorrow. I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again. How those children 
  	did tear about here! This bedstead is fairly gnawed! But I must get to work. I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the 
  	front path. I don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, till John comes. I want to astonish him. I've got a rope 
  	up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her! But I forgot I could not reach 
  	far without anything to stand on ! This bed will not move! I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I bit 
  	off a little piece at one corner - but it hurt my teeth. Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor. It sticks 
  	horribly and the pattern just enjoys it ! All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision 
  	I am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the  window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to 
  	try. Besides I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued. I don't like to 
  	look out of the windows even - there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast. I wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper 
  	as I did? But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope - you don't get me out in the road there ! I suppose I shall have to get back 
  	behind the pattern when it comes night, and that is hard! It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please! I don't 
  	want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennie asks me to. For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow. 
  	But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way. Why there's 
  	John at the door! It is no use, young man, you can't open it!  How he does call and pound! Now he's crying for an axe. It would be a shame to 
  	break down that beautiful door! " John dear! " said I in the gentlest voice, "the key is down by the front: steps, under a plantain leaf! 
  	" That silenced him for a few moments_ Then he said - very quietly indeed. " Open the door, my darling! "I can't," said I. "The key is down 
  	by the front door under a plantain leaf! And then I said it again, several times. very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he had to 
  	go and see, and he got it of course, and came in. He stopped short by the door. "What is the matter?" he cried. "For God's sake, what are you 
  	doing!" I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder. " I've got out at last," said I, " in spite of you and Jane? 
  	And I've pulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back! " Now why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my path 
  	by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!
