  If only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean to try it, little by little. 
  
  <h3>I have found out another funny thing,
  	but I shan't tell it this time! It does not do to trust people too much. </h3>
  	
  	There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe 
  	John is beginning to notice. I don't like the look in his eyes. And I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She had 
  	a very good report to give. She said I slept a good deal in the daytime. John knows I don't sleep very well at night, for all I'm so quiet!
  	
  	<h3> He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving and kind. </h3>
  	
  	As if I couldn't see through him! Still, I don't wonder he acts 
  	so, sleeping under this paper for three months. It only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly affected by it.
