	<h3>
		I think that woman gets out in the daytime!
	</h3>
	
  	 And I'll tell you why - privately I've seen her! I can see her out of everyone of my windows! It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and
  	 
  	 
  	 <h4> most women do not creep by daylight. I see her in that long shaded lane, creeping up and down.</h4>
  	 
  	 I see her in those dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden. I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, 
  	 and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines. I don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught 
  	 creeping by daylight ! 
  	 
  	I always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can't do it at night, for I know John would suspect something 
  	 at once. And 
  	 
  	 <h3>John is so queer now, that I don't want to irritate him. I wish he would take another room!  </h3>
  	 
  	 Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself. I often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once. But, turn as fast as I 
  	 can, I can only see out of one at one time. And though I always see her, she may be able to creep faster than I can turn ! 
  	 
  	 <h4>I have 
  	 watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind. </h4>
